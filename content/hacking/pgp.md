My PGP public key is hosting on my own website:
<https://impl.dev/keys/aimeez.asc>

Keybase and Protonmail use their own ways to generate new keys.
Users can download a PGP private key from Protonmail
and import it to Keybase.
Keybase will generate a new public key from the private key,
which means the user will have two public keys with the same
private key.

My requirement is to copy/paste the public key to Keybase,
but not another new public key.
So this isn't what I need.
I keep a Keybase ID though: <https://keybase.io/aimeedeer>
