Keybase and Protonmail use their own ways to generate new keys.
Users can import a private key from Protonmail to Keybase, and
Keybase will generate a new public key for it,
which means the user will have two public keys with the same
private key.

My requirement is to copy/paste the public key to Keybase, but not another
new public key.
So this isn't what I need.
