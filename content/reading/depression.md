[TED: This could be why you're depressed or anxious](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann%5Fhari%5Fthis%5Fcould%5Fbe%5Fwhy%5Fyou%5Fre%5Fdepressed%5For%5Fanxious/transcript)

> In a moving talk, journalist Johann Hari shares fresh insights
on the causes of depression and anxiety from experts
around the world -- as well as some exciting emerging solutions.
"If you're depressed or anxious, you're not weak and
you're not crazy, you're not, in the main, a machine with broken parts
 -- you're a human being with unmet needs," Hari says.

> We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see
in the throes of depression -- I understand that really well
from personal experience. But with the right help, we can
understand these problems and we can fix these problems together.
But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting
these signals by saying they're a sign of weakness, or madness
or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. We need to
start listening to these signals, because they're telling us
something we really need to hear. It's only when we truly listen to
these signals, and we honor these signals and respect these signals,
that we're going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,
deeper solutions. The cows that are waiting all around us.
