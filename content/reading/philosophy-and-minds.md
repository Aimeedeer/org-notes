[Yaron Brook: Ayn Rand and the Philosophy of Objectivism | Lex Fridman Podcast #138](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOr1YYRljV8)

Yaron Brook introduced a lot of stories about Ayn Rand
in this podcast.
I only read Ayn Rand's book [Atlas Shrugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas%5FShrugged) several years ago,
and I loved it.

I plan to reread [The Red Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6454477-the-red-book) from C.G. Jung
and Friedrich Nietzsche's books.
