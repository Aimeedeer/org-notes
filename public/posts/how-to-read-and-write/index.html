        <p>Read books The Barbell Method of Reading
The Barbell Method takes this into account by integrating your reading habit into your knowledge work with two steps:
 Read the book. Read swiftly but don’t skip any parts  unless they make you vomit or put you to sleep. Mark all the passages that stand out and contain useful, interesting or inspiring information.
 Read the book a second time. But now you read  the marked parts only.</p>

<p><a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/barbell-method-reading/">The Barbell Method of Reading</a></p>
<p>The Barbell Method takes this into account by integrating
your reading habit into your knowledge work with two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the book. Read swiftly but don’t skip any parts</li>
</ul>
<p>unless they make you vomit or put you to sleep.
Mark all the passages that stand out and contain useful,
interesting or inspiring information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the book a second time. But now you read</li>
</ul>
<p>the marked parts only. This time you make notes,
connect them to past notes (Zettelkasten Method!)
and think about what you’ve read.
Make mindmaps, drawings, bullet points –
everything that helps you to think more clearly.</p>
<p>The quality of the book will now determine
how much time you invest in it.
Sometimes, a book is not that important and
only provides a few shallow pieces of information.
The second step could only take
a very short period of time. But a good book is dense.</p>
<p>True reading is not a passive process in which
you just create an influx of information.
It consists of deep processing, thinking and writing on
what you have read and interconnecting it with you already know.</p>
<p>Only the three parts combined, reading, thinking, and writing,
produce a true change in your brain and make you a better thinker.
To write about what you read is important even if
you don’t aim to write books on something.
Still, you have to write if you want to think properly.
Still, you have to write to process information properly.</p>
<p>Don’t try to impress anyone with things you don’t have invested energy into.</p>
<p>At last, you are what you practice regularly.
You are your habits. If your habits don’t include
to really gnaw on ideas and concepts,
you won’t sharpen your mental teeth.
So if you want to be able to think deeply
and properly, practice it.</p>
<p>The Zettelkasten Method is designed to serve several different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the amount of information you process.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should read a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce an archive which consists of true knowledge,</li>
</ul>
<p>not just a collection of half-understood bits of random points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn to think deeply and thoroughly by</li>
</ul>
<p>making it a habit to practice it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">How to Read Paper</a></p>
<p>THE THREE-PASS APPROACH</p>
<p>The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to
three passes, instead of starting at the beginning
and plowing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific
goals and builds upon the previous pass:
The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.
The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details.
The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.</p>
<p>The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of
the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any
more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes
and consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction</li>
<li>Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore</li>
</ol>
<p>everything else</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the conclusions</li>
<li>Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the</li>
</ol>
<p>ones you’ve already read
At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer
the five Cs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Category: What type of paper is this?</li>
</ol>
<p>A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system?
A description of a research prototype?</p>
<ol>
<li>Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which</li>
</ol>
<p>theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?</p>
<ol>
<li>Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?</li>
<li>Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?</li>
<li>Clarity: Is the paper well written?</li>
</ol>
<p>Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most
reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take
care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and
to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer
cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will
likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand
the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely
never be read.</p>
<ul>
<li>My notes on 2020-10-29:</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also true for a business plan, or a blog post</p>
<p>In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but
ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key
points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.</p>
<p>To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are
reviewer, requires a third pass. The key to the third pass
is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is,
making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the
work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper,
you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but
also its hidden failings and assumptions.</p>
<p>This pass requires great attention to detail. You should
identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would
present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual
with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and
presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely
add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you
should also jot down ideas for future work.</p>
<p>This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners,
and about an hour for an experienced reader. At the end
of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire
structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to
identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should
be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations
to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or
analytical techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>My notes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretent I am an investor, to review my business plan.</p>
<p>I’ve used this approach for the last 15 years
to read conference proceedings, write reviews,
do background research,
and to quickly review papers before a discussion.
This disciplined approach prevents me from drowning in the details
before getting a bird’s-eye-view. It allows me to estimate the
amount of time required to review a set of papers.
Moreover, I can adjust the depth of paper evaluation depending
on my needs and how much time I have.</p>
<p>If you are reading a paper to do a review, you should also
read Timothy Roscoe’s paper on “<a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/troscoe/pubs/review-writing.pdf">Writing reviews for systems conferences</a>”.
If you’re planning to write a technical
paper, you should refer both to
<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/hgs/etc/writingstyle.html">Henning Schulzrinne’s comprehensive website</a>
and <a href="http://www.che.iitm.ac.in/misc/dd/writepaper.pdf">George Whitesides’s excellent overview of the process</a>.
Finally, Simon Peyton Jones has a website
that covers <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/simonpj/Papers/givinga-talk/giving-a-talk.htm">the entire spectrum of research skills</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write">How to write</h2>
<p>Very well written, and I learned a lot from
Timothy Roscoe’s paper on “<a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/troscoe/pubs/review-writing.pdf">Writing reviews for systems conferences</a>”.
This is the paper worth reading many times,
and follow his practice.</p>
<p><strong>*First of all, summarize the paper. *</strong>
Give a neutral description of what you think the paper
is about, where the authors are coming from,
why they view the problem as important,
and what they’ve done.
This is a great way to start writing a review,
particularly when you’re not sure how to get started.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Second, state what you think the contributions are.</strong></strong>
It’s rare to find a paper that completely fails to
make any contributions, but it’s much more common to find one that
makes no useful contributions,
or contributions that turn out to be flawed.
In any case, state what the authors think the contributions are,
or, if you think there’s a contribution
you think they’ve missed, what it is.
A surprisingly common mistake among paper
authors is to fail to state the contribution -
if that’s the case, gently point this out (see
“Tone” below), but try to fill it in.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Next, give your specific comments</strong></strong> on the paper
by working through the scribbles you made
on first (or second) reading.
Often you may find your opinion has changed in the meantime,
which is fine (you may even have learned something!).
Some reviewers like to separate their comments
into technical discussion, and then small points like typos
and other mistakes, often referred to as “nits”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, provide some kind of conclusion at the end.
If you like, summarize the good
points and bad points separately,
but the important thing is to give
a brief recommendation for the paper and your reasons for it.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Consequently, tone is important.</strong></strong></p>
<p>Rather than saying “this paper doesn’t cite Multics, which did everything you do and
more”, it’s better to say something like “This paper reminded me of Multics, which
seems quite similar. I would find the paper more persuasive if it stated what the authors
do over and above Multics.”</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that, in all cases, there is a still a remote possibility that you’ve
misunderstood the paper. Hence, a flat assertion like “The algorithm given in the paper
breaks in the presence of Byzantine faults” is risky, and may be unfair to the authors.
It’s better to write “The description in the paper left me worried that algorithm breaks
in the presence of Byzantine faults.”, preferably followed by a sketch of why you think
this is the case.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></p>
<p>Writing a good review is important: it helps the authors do better work, it helps you
to learn more about the subject being reviewed, and it makes you look good in front
of your peers. Surprisingly, it can also be fun – even writing a review for a really bad
paper can be rewarding if it forces you to explain concepts afresh in a new context.</p>
